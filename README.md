  - The upper case is the case when each letter is in the upper case. 
    For example, 'THIS IS THE UPPER CASE TEXT.'
  - The lower case is the case when each letter is in the lower case. 
    For example, 'this is the lower case text.'
  -The proper case is the case when each word starts with the upper case, and the rest of the word is in the lower. 
    For example, 'This Is The Proper Case Text.'
  - The sentence case is the case when each sentence starts with an upper case letter, and the rest of the sentence is in the lower case. 
    In example, 'This is the sentence case. Only the first word of the sentence starts with an upper case letter.'
